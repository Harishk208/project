    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu
      family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his
      mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother,
      Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[9] Kohli's formative years were spent
      in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public
      School
    </p>
    <p>
      n 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of
      that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for
      cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him
      to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[12] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours,
      Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket
      academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than
      just playing in gully cricket.[13] Despite his abilities, he faced the
      setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team,
      supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received
      offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured
      his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his
      way into the under-15 Delhi team.

    <p>
      Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical
      abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.His customarily batting position
      in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,and
      a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his
      agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly
      orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.In his
      batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather
      than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute
      wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.
    </p>
    <h3>Aggression</h3>
    <p>
      Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that
      extends to his leadership on the field. He is well known for his
      passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a
      fierce competitiveness.[55][56] His captaincy is characterized as
      proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the team by example.[57]
      Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the
      early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant
      individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics and former
      cricketers alike.[58][59] While some have praised his assertiveness and
      confidence,[60][61] others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing
      the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in
      a loss of composure
