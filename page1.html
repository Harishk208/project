    Samantha began her professional film career with Gautham Vasudev Menon's
    Telugu film, Ye Maaya Chesave (2010). The film, simultaneously made in Tamil
    as Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010), was highly anticipated prior to release,
    primarily due to the first time collaboration between Gautham Menon and
    composer A. R. Rahman.The actress successfully auditioned and was signed up
    for the project in August 2009. The film was shot in India and the United
    States, and it was released on 26 February 2010.Post-release, she revealed

    her how to remain natural and comfortable in front of the screen, even if
    she had no dialogues in a scene.In the film, Samantha played the lead
    character Jessie, a Malayali Saint Thomas Christian girl living in

  <h2>Media image and artistry</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    The success of Ye Maaya Chesave (2010) and subsequent back-to-back successes
    prompted Rediff.com to label her "the most sought-after actress in the
    Telugu film industry" in 2014.Her initial choice of films depicted her as an
    actress who actively selects to feature in strong female roles, with The
    Times of India noting that "scripts are written around the characters she
    portrays" and that she held a place in the "wishlist of every top actor,
    director and producer".Her inclusion in Telugu film projects were also
    initially considered a "lucky charm" by producers, though Samantha
    acknowledged that though "destiny" played a role in her career, and that
    there were "many women out there who are more beautiful and more talented"
    than she was and that she hoped her name would instead be "synonymous with
    hard work".Samantha also stated that she was willing to forgo her salary
    demands to appear in good films, revealing that she worked on Gautham
    Vasudev Menon's films for lower fees and that she had rejected more
    lucrative offers to feature in S. S. Rajamouli's Eega (2012).
