    mixed reviews.In Vallavan, she portrayed a lecturer who falls in love with a

    songs and does justice to her well-etched out role".[39] The science fiction
    thriller E featured Nayanthara in the role of a bar dancer. Reviewers from
    Rediff stated that she made an impact.[40] Indiaglitz said she was "very
    adequate and impressive in a slightly complicated role",[41] and that she

    film.

    her, describing her as a "show-stopper". The reviewer further wrote:

    beautiful body which she flaunts daringly [...] and is also able to bring
    out the cold aloofness and bitterness of her character.Similarly a critic
    from Nowrunning.com noted that she looked "great in mini-skirts, jacket,
    dark glasses and tall boots".Her performance in Billa earned her first
